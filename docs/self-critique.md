# Self-Critique

## Orient 

### Strengths  
-  **Clear problem statement with real-world impact** – The optimization goal is well-defined, and its importance for grid stability and renewable energy efficiency is effectively communicated.  
- **Logical and structured report** – The report presents a step-by-step breakdown of the problem, the chosen methodology, and plans for implementation, making it easy to follow and progress throughout the project.
- **Early validation through regression analysis** – Initial proof-of-life experiments, like the regression analysis between weather and energy production, provide a solid foundation for moving forward  

### Areas for Improvement  
- **Uncertainty in real-world constraints** – While broad constraints for energy production, demand, and storage have been identified, the verification of the overall energy production process through industry insights can help improve the real-world applicability of these restraints. 
- **Data availability and preprocessing considerations** – The report identifies required data, but there isn’t a clear strategy for integrating different data sources, or adapting to situations where real-world data may be incomplete.
- **Simplified decision framework in early model** – The current binary application of to send or to store might need a more dynamic plan to be applied in the real-world. 

###  Critical Risks/Assumptions
The biggest technical risk is that the RL model may not generalize well to unseen weather or demand patterns, leading to unreliable energy allocation decisions. The hardest data challenge is obtaining accurate, high-resolution hourly demand data for Southern California, which is essential for realistic model training and validation. Our most important assumption is that weather strongly determines both the supply of renewable energy and demand fluctuations, but external factors (e.g., market conditions, industrial activity) may also play significant roles. Additionally, a major implementation challenge is scaling up the model to handle more complex grid setups with multiple energy sources, BESS storage units, and realistic operational constraints.

## Decide

- **Gather industry insights to refine real-world constraints** - Reach out to solar and wind companies to validate assumptions and gain more data.
- **Develop a strategy for handling missing or incomplete data** - Plan preprocessing steps and investigate datasets that has complete data.
- **Expand the decision-making framework beyond binary choices** - Use information from the experts to determine the best decision making framework to apply.
